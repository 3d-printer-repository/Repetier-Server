Linux / Raspberry Pi

Installing required software:

I assume a fresh Wheezy image on a raspberry pi. On other linux systems you might also
need to install gcc, make and other development tools.

sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
sudo apt-get install git

Fetch the sources:


MacOS:

Install macports from http://www.macports.org/install.php
Install boost library: sudo port install boost

./bjam toolset=darwin address-model=32_64 architecture=x86


Compilation using CMake

go to build directory

Compile with Visual Studio 2008:
cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" ..
cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ..

Compile with default system compiler:
cmake ..

If you need defines to find the boost library, add them with -D<Name>=<Value>

After cmake finishes with succes your build system is ready.
