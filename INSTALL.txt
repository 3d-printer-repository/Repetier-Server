Linux / Raspberry Pi

Installing required software:

I assume a fresh Wheezy image on a raspberry pi. On other linux systems you might also
need to install gcc, make and other development tools.

sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
sudo apt-get install git

Fetch the sources:


MacOS:

Install macports from http://www.macports.org/install.php
Install boost library: sudo port install boost
