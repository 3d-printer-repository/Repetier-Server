The server is written in C/C++ using the boost libraries for highest portability.
It is tested under MacOS 10.8 / Raspberry PI / Windows VS 2008 but different OSes
should work as well. For makefile creation the platform independent CMake is used.

Linux / Raspberry Pi walkthrough

Installing required software:

I assume a fresh Wheezy image on a raspberry pi. On other linux systems you might also
need to install gcc, make and other development tools.

sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install git

Get latest version from Github for the first time:
> git clone git://github.com/repetier/Repetier-Server.git
for later updates you only need to issue
> git pull
inside the Repetier-Server directory to update to newest sources.

Compilation using CMake

Inside the toplevel directory downloaded create a directory build
> mkdir build
  
Go to build directory
	cd build
	
Create make system for default system compiler:
>	cmake ..

Compile sources:
> make

After cmake finishes with succes your build system is ready. On a Linux system
you now have the RepetierServer executable. On other systems you might have trouble
finding the boost libraries. Edit the toplevel CMakeLists.txt and add the directories
for your computer and retry.

=== Configure Runtime Environment ===

Copy executable to /usr/bin
> sudo cp RepetierServer /usr/bin

Copy a sample config file to /etc
> sudo cp ../linux/repetier-server.conf /etc

Create a environment where the server can store it's data and printer configs.
> sudo mkdir /var/lib/Repetier-Server /var/lib/Repetier-Server/configs /var/lib/Repetier-Server/www /var/lib/Repetier-Server/storage /var/lib/Repetier-Server/languages

Copy the content of www and languages to the created directories
> sudo cp -r ../www/* /var/lib/Repetier-Server/www
> sudo cp ../languages/* /var/lib/Repetier-Server/languages

Create a start init script to run the server as daemon upon boot time.
> sudo cp ../linux/init_Repetier-Server_debian /etc/init.d/Repetier-Server
> sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/Repetier-Server

Activate start script:
> sudo update-rc.d Repetier-Server defaults

Now your start script is active on next reboot. To start/stop manually use
> sudo /etc/init.d/Repetier-Server start
> sudo /etc/init.d/Repetier-Server stop


================== OS Dependent hints =====================

=== Windows ===

Compile with Visual Studio 2008:
> cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" ..
Compile with Visual Studio 2010:
> cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ..

=== MacOS ===

How to get boost:
Install macports from http://www.macports.org/install.php
Install boost library: sudo port install boost

or compile boost yourself

> ./bjam toolset=darwin address-model=32_64 architecture=x86
