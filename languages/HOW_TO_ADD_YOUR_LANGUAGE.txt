Make your own translation
==========================

Making your own translation is as easy as it could be. Go to

http://www.poedit.net/

and fetch the PO-editor for your os. Let is scan the www folder for translation and
translate all it found. Save the file with the 2 letter digits for your country into
the languages folder, restart the server and you are done. If your browser language
is not detected correctly you might want to change the default language in 
repetier-server.conf to your favourite language.

Other user would be glad, if you send me the new translation to include. With sending me
the translation to repetierdev@gmail.com you consent to include it for free into the
software. You can add your credits into the po file if you want to.
